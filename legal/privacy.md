### 3.1 How AI Processing Works

Qualy is an AI-assisted customer communication and lead qualification platform. **Your conversations, messages, and customer interactions are processed by third-party large language model (LLM) providers** to deliver the Service's core features. Specifically:

| Feature | Data Sent to LLM | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Auto-Reply Engine** | Customer messages, skill definitions, knowledge base content | Generate contextual responses to customer inquiries |
| **Lead Extraction** | Conversation history (last 5 customer messages + recent role-labeled turns) | Extract service type, date, location, budget, intent, and risk signals |
| **Lead Scoring** | Extracted lead signals and conversation snapshot | Produce 0–10 qualification score and status classification |
| **Knowledge Base (RAG)** | Customer queries + relevant knowledge chunks | Generate grounded answers from your uploaded FAQ/policies |
| **Conversation Summary** | Full conversation history | Produce on-demand conversation summaries |
| **Offering Profile** | Skills, knowledge base content | Generate service offering suggestions |
| **Required Fields** | Skills, knowledge base content, existing fields | Suggest intake fields for lead qualification |

### 3.2 Third-Party LLM Providers

We currently use:

- **OpenAI (OpenAI, L.L.C., San Francisco, USA)** — GPT-4o-mini model for text generation and inference; text-embedding models for semantic search and skill matching.

We may change or add LLM providers in the future. Any such change will be reflected in an update to this Privacy Policy.

### 3.3 What This Means for You

- Conversation content from your connected channels is transmitted to OpenAI's API servers located in the **United States** for processing.
- We use OpenAI's API (not ChatGPT consumer product). OpenAI's API data usage policy states that API data is not used to train their models.
