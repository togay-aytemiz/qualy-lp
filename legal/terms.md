- AI outputs may be incomplete, incorrect, or unsuitable for your use case.
- You remain responsible for reviewing and approving communications before sending (unless you explicitly enable automation rules).
- You must not rely on AI outputs as legal, medical, financial, or other professional advice.

## 7. Third-Party Services

The Service may rely on third-party products and infrastructure (for example, messaging providers, cloud services, analytics, and model providers).

Your use of third-party integrations may be subject to separate third-party terms and policies.

We are not responsible for third-party service availability, acts, or omissions.

## 8. Fees, Subscriptions, and Trials

If you purchase a paid plan:

- Fees are charged according to your selected plan and billing cycle.
- Unless otherwise stated, fees are non-refundable.

Free trials or promotional access may be limited, modified, or terminated at any time.

## 9. Intellectual Property

Qualy and its licensors retain all rights in and to the Service, including software, designs, trademarks, and documentation.

Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable right to use the Service for your internal business purposes.

## 10. Customer Data and Privacy

As between you and Qualy, you retain rights to your customer data and workspace content.

We process data according to our Privacy Policy. You are responsible for obtaining all necessary notices and consents from your end users where required.

## 11. Confidentiality

Each party may receive confidential information from the other party.

Each party agrees to protect confidential information using reasonable care and to use it only as needed to perform obligations under these Terms.

## 12. Suspension and Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access if:

- You breach these Terms.
- We are required to do so by law.
- Continued access creates security or legal risk.

You may stop using the Service at any time.

Upon termination, rights granted under these Terms end, except provisions that by nature survive termination (including payment obligations, disclaimers, and limitation of liability).

## 13. Disclaimers

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

## 16. Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time.

## 17. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by applicable laws of the jurisdiction where Qualy is established, without regard to conflict-of-law principles, unless mandatory law requires otherwise.

## 18. Entire Agreement

These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any applicable order forms, constitute the entire agreement between you and Qualy regarding the Service and supersede prior agreements on the same subject.
